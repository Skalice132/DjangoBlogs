# DjangoBlogs
I'm starting to study Django and I want to learn how to use Git. I hope I can use this at my new job.

Quick start.

Run the following commands in Terminal:

  1. Install requirements:

      pip install -r requirements.txt

  2. Migrations:

      python manage.py migrate

  3. Start to run server:

      python manage.py runserver
